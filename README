This is an experimental RabbitMQ plugin to provide SNMP statistics.  It has yet to see production use.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

based off of: http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html

1: Setup your rabbitmq build environment
  $ hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella
  $ make co

2: Switch to the rabbitmq_v1_7_0 tag for rabbitmq-server(a dependency for rabbit_snmp)
  $ cd rabbitmq-server
  $ hg checkout -r rabbitmq_v1_7_0

3: Make the server
  $ make

4: Build the rabbitmq_snmp_plugin
  $ cd ../rabbitmq-snmp-plugin
  $ make

5: Install the dist/rabbitmq-snmp.ez plugin into your server.

6: Add the following to you RabbitMQ configuration (usually /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config):

  {rabbit_snmp,
   [
    % set the desired data update interval in milliseconds
    {update_interval, 10000}
   ]
  },
  {snmp, [
    {agent, [
      % db_dir will be set by the snmp plugin before it starts snmp so leave this commented out
      %{db_dir, ""},
      {versions, [v1, v2]},
      % dir will be added by the snmp plugin before it starts snmp, so dont add it to the config block below
      {config, [{verbosity, silence}]},
      {net_if, [{verbosity, silence}]}
    ]},
    {verbosity, silence}
  ]}

Test instructions.

1: snmp walk
  $ snmpwalk -v 1 -c public 127.0.0.1:4001 1.3.6.1.4

Notes:
  The oids are named off the vhost/name combo so you can add/remove them without worrying about changing their indexes.
